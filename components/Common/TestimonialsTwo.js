                            <p>One of the great things about Strapsessions is that they not only have a huge selection of firearms, they also have tons of gun parts for those who want to customize their guns</p>

                            <p>I have been dealing with Strapsessions since 2014 and I must say this is the best online company to deal with, I have tried others just to compare and no one compares to Strapsessions, fast shipping, great inventory and the best customer service. I had order a rifle and a week later I was sent a email saying it was out if stock, when I complained to Strapsessions about taking my money for a gun not in stock they explained due to many orders inventory was hard to keep up they rushed my refund and gave me $25 credit. This is the only online company i will deal with most others suck.</p>
