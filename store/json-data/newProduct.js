      "Walther Arms 5080301 CCP Single 9mm 3.5'' 8+1 Integral Grip SS. The all new CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an idealcombination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability toconceal comfortably. The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowbacktechnology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. Introducing Walthers patented Soft coil design, The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure fromthe ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrelin front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion ofthe slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside ofa cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion ofthe slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has leftthe barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, openingthe breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.The Walther CCP features a  ambidextrous push button magazine release and a manual safety lever on the left side of the gun. The Walther CCP features an accessory rail and features a 5.5 lb trigger pull for the best combination of ease and weight for enhanced shooting characteristics. If you are in the market for a very small and lightweight concealable handgun, then check out the line of CCP pistols from Walther. ",

        "Finally available for public consumption is the much anticipated Scorpion sub-gun. Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Open sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Starting in 2016, Scorpion Pistols feature 1/2x28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2x28 or 18x1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. With a wealth of accessories and attachments available for the Scorpion platform, customization can easily be done with a number of braces, grips, forends, magazines, safeties, mag releases, charging handles and triggers designed specifically for the EVO 3 platform.Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4'' sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants. The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol.",
